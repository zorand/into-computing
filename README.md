# Into-Computing

Are you into computing? Join us then!

## Introduction to Computing

The goal of this project is to create a beginners course in programming (coding), algorithms, computer systems and Computer Science in general. Our main motivation is to help gifted students in their early years (aproximate age 9 to 15) and prepare them for programming contests and undergraduate programs in Computer Science, helping build next generation of talent to continue ongoing computing revolution.
